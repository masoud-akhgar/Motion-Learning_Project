open PNG file (at the end of the list above) to see a fully descripted article about Motion-Learning_Project

I learned different and novel models through this research such as :
- various Mathematics rules 
- LSTM-based or Neural Network Based Prediction Systems
- How to utilizing Image and Signal Processing methods in commerical system models
