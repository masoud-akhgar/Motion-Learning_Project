# the list above is the list of papers that I personally presented, actually it is plus the novel modelings presented by 6 other people 

# Motion-Learning_Project
open PNG file (at the end of the list above) to see a fully descripted article about Motion-Learning_Project

I learned different and novel models through this research such as :
- various Mathematics rules 
- RNN / LSTM-based or generally Neural Network Based Prediction Systems
- novel ideas about utilizing Images and Signals' data to develop models in commerical systems
