# the list above is the list of papers that I personally presented, actually it is a part of the papers presented by all group.

(the list above includes the origianl paper and my presentations, and on of the presentation files is in persian)
I learned different and novel models through this research such as :
- various Mathematics rules 
- RNN / LSTM-based or generally Neural Network Based Prediction Systems
- novel ideas about utilizing Images and Signals' data to develop models in commerical systems and how to capture/transform and use the signals in different ways in the ML models.
